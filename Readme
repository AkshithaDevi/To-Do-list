#languages used are HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, NODE
I have provided 3 code files of html,css and ejs where you set up them in your text editor and open your terminal to run the code
before running the javascript code open your terminal, set the path to the profile directory and run the following commands->
commands:
npm init
npm start
npm i express, body-parser
npm i ejs
npm i nodemon #this nodemon helps to keep track and updates the server automatically when any changes are made in js file
noodemon app.js #runs the js file in the localhost , open your browser and got to localhost:3000/
